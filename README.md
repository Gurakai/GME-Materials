Notes

***To make full use of my mod, crafttweaker or kubejs is recomended.***

This mod came about from me wanting my own mod to do what I needed without worry of infringing on other mod devs or having too much bloat within my mod-pack. Most code was made with help from TurtyWurty's tutorial videos and BluSunrise allowing public viewing of his code. I appreciate the ability of these devs and love their work. Other credit goes to Team COFH, Brandon3055, and of course minecraft and forge.
